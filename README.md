# 1.What is PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL (often abbreviated as Postgres) is a powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is known for its robust features, standards compliance, and strong support for complex queries and data integrity.

Key Features of PostgreSQL:
- Open Source
- ACID Compliant
- SQL and NoSQL Capabilities
- Extensibility
- Concurrency
- Advanced Indexing and Full-text Search
- Foreign Data Wrappers

# 2.What is the purpose of a database schema in PostgreSQL?
In PostgreSQL, a database schema serves as a namespace within a database that organizes and separates database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, functions, and sequences. The primary purpose of a schema is to provide logical grouping and structure to database objects, which helps in managing complexity, enhancing security, and avoiding name collisions.

Purposes of a Schema in PostgreSQL:
- Namespace Management
- Organization
- Access Control and Security
- Support for Multi-Tenancy
- Ease of Development and Maintenance
- Modular Design

# 3.Explain the Primary Key and Foreign Key concepts in PostgreSQL.
In PostgreSQL, Primary Key and Foreign Key are crucial concepts for maintaining data integrity and defining relationships between tables.

ðŸ”‘ Primary Key
A Primary Key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table.

Characteristics:
- Unique
- Not NULL
- A table can have only one primary key

ðŸ”— Foreign Key
A Foreign Key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key (or a unique key) in another table. It creates a relationship between two tables.

Purpose:
- Ensures referential integrity
- Helps maintain consistent and connected data across tables
